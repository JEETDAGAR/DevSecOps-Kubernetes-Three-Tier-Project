Project Insights

Microservices Codebase
Uncover the intricacies of our microservices in the Microservices-Source directory. Each service is a self-contained unit, ready for individual scaling and deployment.
Automated Build Pipelines
The CI-Pipelines folder houses our continuous integration scripts. These pipelines ensure code quality, run tests, and prepare our services for deployment with minimal human intervention.
Cloud Resource Blueprints
Dive into Infrastructure-Templates to explore our infrastructure-as-code solutions. These blueprints allow for consistent and repeatable cloud environment setups across different stages of development.
Orchestration Configurations
Within Orchestration-Manifests, you'll find the configuration files for our container orchestration platform. These manifests define how our microservices are deployed, scaled, and interconnected in the cloud environment.
