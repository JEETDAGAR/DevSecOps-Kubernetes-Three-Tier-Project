## Application Code

The `Application-Code` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the frontend and backend implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code

In the `Jenkins-Pipeline-Code` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts. These scripts automate the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth integration and deployment of your application.

## Jenkins Server Terraform

Explore the `Jenkins-Server-TF` directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins Server on AWS. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files

The `Kubernetes-Manifests-Files` directory holds Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application on AWS EKS. Understand and customize these files to suit your project needs.

## Project Details

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Explored:

- **Terraform & AWS CLI**: For AWS infrastructure provisioning.
- **Jenkins, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl**: For comprehensive CI/CD setup.
- **Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana**: For efficient monitoring.
- **ArgoCD**: For implementing GitOps practices.

### üö¢ High-Level Overview:

- **IAM User setup & Terraform magic on AWS**: Secure IAM user configurations and automated infrastructure deployment.
